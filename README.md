This plugin adds a simple HTML-UI and a REST service. Together both provide the possibility to create unique "User Account"-Items in DeepaMehta via two OpenID-Authentication Providers (Google and Yahoo).

It is based on the [JOpenID library](https://code.google.com/p/jopenid) from [Michael Lao](http://www.liaoxuefeng.com) which is available under Apache License 2.0.

This plugin is tested to work with [DeepaMehta 4.1.1-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/jri/deepamehta/commit/a6ded128b62959617f76955546405d96426825ca) (and later) and depends on the installation of the [dm4-webactivator 0.4.1](https://github.com/jri/dm4-webactivator) plugin.
