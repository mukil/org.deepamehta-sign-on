# org.deepamehta Sign-on Module

A DeepaMehta 4 plugin adding a simple HTML-UI and a REST service for OpenID-Authentication and DeepaMehta 4 User Accounts. Currently this plugin only supports authentication through an existing Google or a Yahoo account.

It does so through extending the model of a DeepaMehta 4 "User Account" about an "OpenID" child type (of type Text).

This plugin is based on the [JOpenID library](https://code.google.com/p/jopenid) from [Michael Lao](http://www.liaoxuefeng.com) which is available under Apache License 2.0.
